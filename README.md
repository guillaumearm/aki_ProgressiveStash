# Trap's Progressive Stash

> `Edge of Darkness` but with a feeling of progress.

This repo is a mod for [sp-tarkov](https://sp-tarkov.com/)

## Description
You start with a level 1 stash but its size has been increased to 10x68 (`Edge of Darkness` stash) and your secure container is a simple waist pouch but its size has been increased to reflect the gamma container size (3x3).

Your starting stuff is same as in `Edge of Darkness` edition.

## Usage
I highly recommend to create a new profile with the `Trap's Progressive Stash` edition selected but if you want to use the `Standard` edition, it's fine too.

## Features

There are 4 tiers of stash upgrades: 
- Tier 1: 10x68
- Tier 2: 10x100
- Tier 3: 10x132
- Tier 4: 10x164

All secure containers size has been modified and can be crafted in the workbench:
- Waist Pouch: 3x3
- Alpha: 4x4
- Beta: 5x5
- Epsilon: 6x6
- Gamma: 6x8
- Kappa: 6x10

## Configuration
Everything is configurable: the size of the different stashes and secure containers, the crafts requirements and even the requirements to upgrade the stash. Check the default `config/config.json` file for more details.


## AKI Compatiblity
It's compatible with spt-aki 3.0.0
